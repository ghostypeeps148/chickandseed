# chickandseed
A video game I made using python.
It all started with a game called "Hungry Cat".
It was a Scratch project, a coding language that I code sometimes but not often.The game was quite a project but it was a starter level project.
It was a game that you move the cat around to eat apples. But, you are forced to use duplicate to make more.
I thought, Why not make this better with cloning?
So I did.
Someone gave me the idea to make it Chick and Seed, and eventually it came to this video game.
